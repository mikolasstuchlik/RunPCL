// You need to install LLVM as described in `â€“ Linker Errors After Compilation`

// You can use `$ swift package generate-xcodeproj` in order to generate Xcode project
// The advantage of this is, that the SourceKit works, since it can find all the deader files.
// The disadvantage is, that Bundle.module won't work, you need to add resources in different way.
